# Description
We are building a online newspaper using Node.js as the backend framework, with Handlebars (HBS) and EJS as templating engines for rendering dynamic views. For the frontend, we use Bootstrap 4 for responsive design and styling. The application interacts with a MySQL database to manage and store data efficiently.

This is a non-profit project developed solely for educational purposes. We strictly do not intend to use this project for any commercial purposes or to violate intellectual property rights.
